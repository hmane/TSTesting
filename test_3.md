Scope of the Business Requirement Document
The scope of this document is to define the high-level business requirements for the Legal Workflow System (LRS), a new platform designed to automate and streamline the organization's legal and compliance review process for marketing communications. The primary business problem this initiative addresses is the inefficiency, lack of visibility, and potential compliance risk associated with the current manual, email-based review system.

This document outlines the business need for a centralized system that provides automated routing, real-time status tracking, and a complete, auditable trail for all review requests. The core business objective is to achieve significant time savings, reduce compliance risks, and provide transparency for all stakeholders involved in the review lifecycle.

The requirements detailed herein focus on the initial implementation phase (Phase 1), which specifically covers the end-to-end workflow for "Communication Request" types. This includes the processes for request submission, legal intake, attorney and compliance reviews, and final closeout, along with the necessary document management, role-based security, and reporting capabilities to support these functions. Future phases, such as the integration of other request types or advanced system integrations, are considered out of scope for this initial set of business requirements but are noted for future planning.
